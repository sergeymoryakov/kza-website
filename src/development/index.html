                            Aviation, where he spearheaded sales efforts in
                            Central Asia, an untapped region for the company.
                            His responsibilities included identifying new
                            opportunities, crafting persuasive sales proposals,
                            negotiating value propositions, and ultimately
                            closing deals. This endeavor set the stage for
                            numerous successful campaigns, including the
                            selection of GEnx engines for Uzbekistan Airways and
                            Azerbaijan Airlines' 787 fleet, as well as
                            collaborative efforts with the CFM team to promote
                            CFM56 power for the A320 family.

                            volume deal in the region.

                            offered Alexander invaluable leadership experience.
                            Over eight years with Textron, his team achieved
